# GREMLINS
A Memory Manager implementation using simple linked list for the Basic Structure Data I course on UFRN.

## Objective
This project aims to feel the usage of linked lists in a real-application context. The choosen application is a **memory manager** (MM).

But why to implement a memory manager if the system already provides one? Well, the system manager has a lot more to do than just give you the memory that you ask it. By this statement, it becomes logical that if we implement a memory manager that takes the necessary memory on the begin of the program and manage it for us, it will become a lot faster.

This kind of code is developed mostly for game engines and graphical programs, that normally demands a quick response to memory needs.

## Compilation
To compile this program, you will need at least `gcc` linux utility and `make`. After you download this repo either by cloning it or fetching the zip by the github platform, you can type on a terminal window on your linux/unix based system:
```
make; ./gremlins
```
Then see for yourself the memory manager working on a few examples we made it.
